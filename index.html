        <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
        <div class="file-card">
            <p>I am Skyler Fellenz, a Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Florida with hands on experience in mechanical design, CAD modeling, and engineering documentation. My work centers on translating functional requirements into manufacturable components, supported by clear drawings, tolerancing, and system level thinking.
            
            <p>
                I have experience in collaborative engineering environments through design teams focused on assistive devices and advanced manufacturing systems. In these roles, I contribute mechanical designs in SOLIDWORKS, develop build to print drawings using GD and T, and coordinate across mechanical, electrical, and software teams to ensure interface alignment and manufacturability. I am certified as a SOLIDWORKS Associate and have completed extensive part and assembly modeling work intended for controlled release and repeatable production. <p>

            <p>
                I am currently studying abroad at the Technical University of Denmark, where I am gaining exposure to international engineering standards and workflows. This experience has strengthened my ability to adapt to new systems, communicate across cultures, and approach engineering problems with a broader perspective.</p>

            </p>
                Alongside technical work, I bring reliability and operational awareness from roles supporting large scale events, as well as leadership experience through professional and service organizations. I am seeking opportunities in mechanical design, biomechancis, data analysis, manufacturing, testing, and maintenance engineering where structured problem solving and clear documentation matter.</p>
