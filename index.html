        <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
        <div class="file-card">
            <p>I am Skyler Fellenz, a Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Florida with hands-on experience in mechanical design, CAD modeling, and engineering documentation. My work centers on translating functional requirements into manufacturable components, supported by clear drawings, tolerancing, and system-level thinking.</p>
            <p>I have experience in collaborative engineering environments through design teams focused on assistive devices and advanced manufacturing systems. In these roles, I contribute mechanical designs in SOLIDWORKS, develop build-to-print drawings using GD&T, and coordinate across mechanical, electrical, and software teams to ensure interface alignment and manufacturability. I am certified as a SOLIDWORKS Associate and have completed extensive part and assembly modeling work intended for controlled release and repeatable production.</p>
            <p>I am currently studying abroad at the Technical University of Denmark, where I am gaining exposure to international engineering standards and workflows. This experience has strengthened my ability to adapt to new systems, communicate across cultures, and approach engineering problems with a broader perspective.</p>
            <p>Alongside technical work, I bring reliability and operational awareness from roles supporting large-scale events, as well as leadership experience through professional and service organizations. I am seeking opportunities in mechanical design, manufacturing, testing, and maintenance engineering where structured problem-solving and clear documentation matter.</p>
